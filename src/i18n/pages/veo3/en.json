      },
      {
        "question": "How long are Veo 3 generated videos?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How can I get better Veo 3 video quality?",
        "answer": "To achieve the best Veo 3 video quality, follow these recommendations: 1) Use detailed and specific prompts that clearly describe the scene, actions, lighting, and style you want; 2) Choose Quality Mode (Veo 3 standard model) instead of Fast Mode for more refined video results; 3) For 16:9 aspect ratio videos, you can upgrade to 1080P HD version for crystal-clear viewing experience and professional presentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my video generation always fail?",
        "answer": "Video generation failures typically occur for several reasons: 1) Your prompt may violate content policies, especially when involving real people, children, violence, or sensitive content - Veo 3 will reject such requests; 2) Carefully review the specific error message returned by the system, which will indicate the exact reason for failure; 3) If the issue persists, contact our technical support team for assistance in diagnosing and resolving the problem. Modifying your prompt to comply with policy requirements usually resolves most generation failures."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to generate Veo 3 videos longer than 8 seconds?",
        "answer": "Individual video clips created directly in Veo 3 are limited to 8 seconds. If you need to create longer video content, you can generate multiple 8-second video clips separately, then use external video editing tools (such as Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, or CapCut) to stitch these clips together into a complete longer video. This approach allows you to create professional video works of any length while maintaining high quality for each segment."
